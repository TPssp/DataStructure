## Introduction

In this repository, I aim to provide practical implementations of fundamental data structures. Understanding data structures is crucial for any programmer, as they form the building blocks of efficient algorithms and problem-solving. This project is a part of my ongoing journey to deepen my understanding of data structures.

## Data Structures

Currently, I have implemented the following data structures:

- [Sequential List](./cpp)

Each data structure is organized in its own directory, containing the source code and accompanying documentation.

## Languages

I have chosen to implement these data structures in the following programming language:

- [C++](./cpp)

## How to Use

To use any of the data structures in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the specific data structure directory.
2. Choose the programming language you are comfortable with.
3. Review the source code and accompanying documentation for that language.
4. Incorporate the code into your own projects as needed.

Please note that this repository is primarily for educational purposes, and I encourage you to explore and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding.
